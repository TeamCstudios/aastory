Dear Diary,<br>
Today was the first day of school at Lehelna. I decided I should keep a diary to remember this years on from now. I have a dorm with Fausta Ambrosi, a Lehelna local who's in the school newspaper club. My family is not high society, but plenty of my extended family is well known because a lot of them are adventurers. So, I came to Lehelna because anyone who's anyone in my family went here. My sister Bria is """sick""" but I know she's faking to get out of class, she always does this according to Fausta.

When I went into the first-years building, I saw a cute girl who looked sorcererly, but she didn't go into Sorcerer's Initiation, where I was going.  She noticed that I was staring at her, and she looked embarrassed.

Initiation was great. We practised *Tenser's floating disk* and sat on them.

I'm in the dorm now and Fausta is talking about how great the Fighter program is. I'm writing my diary in Elvish so he can't read it and no one else can learn my secrets.

Havaluz be upon us all. The first day of my second-year specialized training went great! Amanda told me that her Fighter course was great as well, when we met up tonight. I'm so lucky to have her.

The Fighter course is really something else. By which I mean it's full of whiny pansies who couldn't hit the side of a building with a sword.

Apparently, I'm supposed to write in a dumb journal every day. Screw that, honestly.

Dear Diary,<br>
Today we learned *detect magic* protocol in Sorcery. Every color of your expanded sight means something. Light red is abjuration, Blue is enchantment, Purple is illusion, and so on. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a blob of crimson. Offhandedly, I asked "Professor Selva, what does very dark red mean?"

He responded "Dark red is a chaotic, uncontrolled magick somewhere between conjuration, abjuration, and evocation. Why do you ask?"

"No reason, just wanted to know."

After the class ended, I continued wandering the halls with *detect magic* active, just to see what I could find. I saw that crimson blob again, but it got bigger the closer I got to the west wall. I decided to seek it out, expecting a wild magic well or eldritch entity or something, and instead I happened upon that same girl I spotted on Thirdday crying, surrounded by magical ice. I dropped my spell and asked her, "What's wrong? Why are you freezing everything?"

She wiped her frozen tears off her face. "It's nothing."

"No, I think you need some help. What happened?"

“People were harassing me for my draconic blood.” She showed me her skin, which had flecks of white.

“That’s terrible. You should get up.”

I helped her up and she told me her name was Kattalin. I told her that she was perfect for the Sorcerer course, and she told me she would try.
